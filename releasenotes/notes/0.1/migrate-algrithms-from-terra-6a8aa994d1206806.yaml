    Qiskit's `qiskit.algorithms` module has been superseded by this
    new standalone library, ``qiskit_algorithms``.

    As of Qiskit's 0.25 release, active development of new
    algorithm features has moved to this new package.

    If you're relying on :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` you should update your
    requirements to also include ``qiskit-algorithms`` and update the imports
    from ``qiskit.algorithms`` to ``qiskit_algorithms``.

    .. note::

        If you have not yet
        migrated from ``QuantumInstance``-based to primitives-based algorithms,
        you should first follow the migration guidelines in https://qisk.it/algo_migration,
        to complete the migration of your code, as this package does not include
        any deprecated algorithm function.

    The decision to migrate the :mod:`qiskit.algorithms` module to a
    separate package was made to clarify the purpose of `Qiskit <https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit>`__ and
    make a distinction between the tools and libraries built on top of it.
