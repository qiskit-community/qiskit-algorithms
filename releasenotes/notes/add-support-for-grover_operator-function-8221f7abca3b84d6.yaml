    :class:`AmplificationProblem` and :class:`EstimationProblem` now use the function
    :func:`~qiskit.circuit.library.grover_operator` to construct the Grover operator
    by default when using Qiskit in its 2.1.0 version or an older one, instead of the 
    class :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.GroverOperator`, to follow with the latter's
    deprecation in Qiskit 2.10. In particular, if these classes are instantiated without
    providing a Grover operator and the new default construction is used, it won't be
    possible to access the attributes of the deprecated class.
