    Resolved the issue with multiply-defined Scipy bounds in :mod:`qiskit_algorithms.optimizers`. In line with Scipy, now only the ``minimize()``
    method supports the ``bounds`` keyword. An error is raised when trying to pass ``bounds`` in the Optimizer constructor
    via ``kwargs`` or ``options``.
