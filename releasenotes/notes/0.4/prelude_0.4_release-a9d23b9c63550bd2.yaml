    This release compiles a series of important updates to the package, including:
    
    - dropped support for Python 3.8 and added support for Python 3.13
    - added support for PrimitivesV2
    - addressed deprecations from the 1.x cycle
    
    These changes allow for qiskit-algorithms to now support 
    `Qiskit 2.x <https://docs.quantum.ibm.com/api/qiskit/release-notes/2.0>`__
    while maintaining support for the 1.x cycle.
