    The list of arguments for :meth:`.QNSPSA.get_fidelity()` has been updated to
    remove the keyword enforcement for ``sampler`` so also allowing it now
    as positional. Additionally the ``sampler`` must be explicitly specified, as a
    valid object, as it no longer supports `None` nor defaults to that.
