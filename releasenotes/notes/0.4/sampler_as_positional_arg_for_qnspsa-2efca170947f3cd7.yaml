upgrade:
  - |
    The list of arguments for `QNSPSA.get_fidelity()` has been updated to
    remove the keyword enforcement for `sampler` so also allowing it now
    as positional. Additionally the `sampler` must be explicitly specified, as a
    valid object, as it no longer supports `None` nor defaults to that.
