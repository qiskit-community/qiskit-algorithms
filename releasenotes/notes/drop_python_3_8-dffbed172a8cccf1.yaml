    Support for Python 3.8 has been dropped.
issues:
  - |
    Qiskit Algorithms does not work with Qiskit version 2.0 (or above).
    Qiskit Algorithms is using Version 1 of the primitives and as they
    were deprecated and then removed in Qiskit 2.0 it needs an earlier
    version that still has them to work. As such Qiskit Algorithms pins
    the qiskit dependency so that a version less than 2.0 will be installed.
upgrade:
  - |
    Python 3.8 support was dropped as Python 3.8 reached End Of Life
    in October 2024 and is no longer being maintained. If you were
    using Python 3.8 you should upgrade to a newer version that Qiskit
    Algorithms now supports.
