prelude: >
    The QNSPSA.get_fidelity function had some deprecated arguments, which 
    just got cleaned up.
features:
  - |
    Allowing to call the QNSPSA.get_fidelity function as
    `QNSPSA(ansatz, sampler)` with the `sampler` option as a positional
    argument (instead of keyword argument).
  - |
    Do not allow the `sampler` option to be `None`.
issues:
  - |
    The original module for QNSPSA allowed the use the `get_fidelity()`
    function without a `sampler` (`sampler=None`), which is deprecated in the
    current version of the code.
upgrade:
  - |
    The list of arguments for `QNSPSA.get_fidelity()` has been updated to
    include only the `ansatz` and the `sampler`, removing previous deprecated
    options, and enforcing a non `None` value for the `sampler`.
deprecations:
  - |
    The `None` value for the `sampler` on the `QNSPSA.get_fidelity()` function
    is no longer valid. A proper sampler must be provided.
