    A couple of algorithms here, :class:`.PVQD`, :class:`.AdaptVQE` and optimizer
    :class:`.SNOBFIT`, directly raised a :class:`~qiskit.exceptions.QiskitError`.
    These have been changed to raise an :class:`.AlgorithmError` instead. Algorithms
    have now been moved out of ``Qiskit`` and this better distinguishes the exception to the
    algorithms when raised. Now ``AlgorithmError`` was already raised elsewhere by the algorithms
    here so this makes things more consistent too. Note, that as ``AlgorithmError``
    internally extends ``QiskitError``, any code that might have caught that specifically
    will continue to work. However we do recommend you update your code accordingly for
    ``AlgorithmError``.
