    Even though ``qiskit-algorithms`` included a ``py.typed`` marker, reporting
    itself as being typed, the types were not checked and contained many errors.
    This will be fixed in the 0.3 release but we are releasing a bugfix release
    in an untyped form to allow dependent packages that are themselves typed to
    continue type checking normally.
