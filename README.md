## Installation

We encourage installing Qiskit Algorithms via the pip tool (a python package manager).

```bash
pip install qiskit-algorithms
```

**pip** will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest
(and well-tested) version.

If you want to work on the very latest work-in-progress versions, either to try features ahead of
their official release or if you want to contribute to Algorithms, then you can install from source.
To do this follow the instructions in the
 [documentation](https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/algorithms/getting_started.html#installation).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Optional Installs

Some optimization algorithms require specific libraries to be run:

* **Scikit-quant**, may be installed using the command `pip install scikit-quant`.

* **SnobFit**, may be installed using the command `pip install SQSnobFit`.

* **NLOpt**, may be installed using the command `pip install nlopt`.
