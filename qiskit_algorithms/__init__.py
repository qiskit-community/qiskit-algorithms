============================================
Qiskit Algorithms (:mod:`qiskit_algorithms`)
============================================
Qiskit Algorithms is a library of quantum algorithms for quantum computing with
`Qiskit <https://qiskit.org>`_.
These algorithms can be used to carry out research and investigate how to solve
problems in different domains on simulators and near-term real quantum devices
using shallow circuits.

The library includes some algorithms, for example the :class:`.NumPyMinimumEigensolver`, which take
the same input as their quantum counterpart but solve the problem classically. This has utility in
the near-term, where problems are still tractable classically, to validate and/or act as a reference.
There are also classical :mod:`.optimizers` for use with variational algorithms such as :class:`.VQE`.

This package also provides common building blocks for algorithms, such quantum circuit
gradients (:mod:`.gradients`) and fidelities of quantum states (:mod:`.state_fidelities`).
These elements are frequently used in a variety of applications, such as variational optimization,
time evolution and quantum machine learning.

The quantum algorithms here all use
`Primitives <https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/primitives.html>`__
to execute quantum circuits. This can be an
``Estimator``, which computes expectation values, or a ``Sampler`` which computes
probability distributions. Refer to the specific algorithm for more information in this regard.

Algorithms
==========

The algorithms now presented are grouped by logical function, such
as minimum eigensolvers, amplitude amplifiers, time evolvers etc. Within each group, the
algorithms conform to an interface that allows them to be used interchangeably
by different applications. E.g. a Qiskit Nature application may take a minimum
eigensolver to solve a ground state problem, and require it to
conform to the :class:`.MinimumEigensolver` interface. Any algorithm that conforms to
the interface, for example :class:`.VQE`, can be used by this application.

knowledge to do this in that application domain.

Minimum Eigensolvers
--------------------
Algorithms to find the minimum eigenvalue of an operator.

This set of these algorithms take an ``Estimator`` primitive and can
solve for a general Hamiltonian.

This set of algorithms take a ``Sampler`` primitive and can only
solve for a diagonal Hamiltonian, such as an Ising Hamiltonian of an optimization problem.

Time Evolvers
-------------
Algorithms to evolve quantum states in time. Both real and imaginary time evolution is possible
with algorithms that support them. For machine learning, Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution might be
used to train Quantum Boltzmann Machine Neural Networks for example.
